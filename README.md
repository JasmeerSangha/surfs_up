## Overview
Asked to identify the temperature variation on hawaiian beaches based on measurement from local weather stations.

## Resources
- Data Sources: hawaii.sqlite
- Software/Tools:Jupyter Lab(pandas)
- Languages: SQL, Python

## Results
The yearly temperature variance is small. When comparing June and December temperatures, the mean, quartiles, standard deviation and maximum recorded temperatures vary by no more than 4°F. The largest difference is between the minimum recorded temperatures which vary by 8°F. With this information one can conclude the beaches temperatures will stay consistant year reound, ideal for the proposed shop.
### Future Analysis ###
The temperature analysis is limited to two months of the year, in future it would be informative to analyse the temperaure fluctuations throughout the entire year. Furthermore, one could do an analysis on the precipitation data, also present in the hawaii.sqlite file. I recommend looking at precipitation data as this can also affect projected monthly profits if some months are particularly rainy.
